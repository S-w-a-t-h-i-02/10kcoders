        <h1>BookMyShow</h1>
        <p>BookMyShow was founded by Ashish Hemrajani, Parikshit Dar and Rajesh Balpande, all three alumni of Sydenham Institute of Management, Mumbai University. They had been working for J.W. Thompson, SPAR and Chatterjee Soros Group, respectively. In 2007 they officially came up with the BookMyShow website. The major purpose of this start-up was to bring the concept of online movie ticketing to India. And soon as it expanded, it started offering online ticketing solutions for theatres, events, concerts and sport
            During its initial years, BookMyShow had a small team managing all the operations.
            It now employs more than 400 people.
             BookMyShow's online ticketing platform is considered to be the main reason behind its success.</p>
