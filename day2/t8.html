Back in 2016, He has started EnGrip with a couple of his colleagues at Oracle. His primary intention is to create an online resume that talks beyond the formal education of people. They started as a browser extension to capture and document the online learning of users and slowly built up an online knowledge profile that includes both (online) informal learning and formal learning.

From July 2018, They have started validating our knowledge profiles vis-a-vis resume and other similar tools available. They first focused on recent graduate hiring space, connecting employers hiring recent graduates, universities/colleges and recent graduates through EnGrip.

<h2>Awareness Gap</h2>
<p>
During their journey in the recent graduate hiring space, we found out that India is wrongly skilled. Too many B.Techs with C++, Java in their resume is increasing the unemployment rate. They saw that colleges focused on bulk recruiters, tell all their students to learn Java, almost all of them. It is hurting the employability prospects of many of these students. Learning the general syntax of Java doesnâ€™t make anyone a programmer.

Students are being misguided and pushed into wrong thinking that a B.Tech degree with a little knowledge of Java gets them a job and it is the responsibility of the employer to train them for the job. They were never told the importance of skillsets as a package and job readiness as a precursor for campus interviews.

Many of the product companies and startups that they have partnered with are willing to hire people with or without a degree as long as they are rightly skilled.
