<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.

Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.

Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups can do things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.
